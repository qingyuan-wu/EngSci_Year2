## Digital and Computer Systems Labs
In the first half of the course we used Verilog, a widely used hardware description language, to model simple logic circuits, ALUs, flip flops, FSMs, as well as some more advanced designs like a restoring divider. We also implemented our Verilog circuits onto real FPGA boards, including interactions with switches and LEDs.

In the latter half of the course we were introduced to the ARM Assembly language. We learned its basic architecture and used it to implement some common algorithms including bubble sort and the recursive Fibnoacci sequence.
