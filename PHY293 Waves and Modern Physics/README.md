## Wave and Modern Physics Labs

My lab partner Regis and I investigated intersting phenomena in waves and modern physics. We replicated Franck and Hertz's famous 1914 Franck-Hertz experiment and observed the quanitzation of energy by the collision of electrons with mercury atoms.

We also used a ripple tank generator to corroborate some well-known wave behaviours as they were observed in water waves, including diffraction, intereference, refraction, and reflection.

See the respective lab folders for the reports of our findings.
